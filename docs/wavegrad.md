## Introduction
WaveGrad is a conditional model for waveform generation which estimates gradients of the data density. It starts from a Gaussian white noise signal and iteratively refines the signal via a gradient-based sampler conditioned on the mel-spectrogram. The model can generate high fidelity audio samples using as few as six iterations.
